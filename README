DRASA
============================================



********************************************
Description
********************************************

Drasa is a simple script to have an overview of italian taxes.

It's dumb and made for my own purposes, so actually can calculate taxes
only for > 30k incomings.

"Regime dei minimi" and other facilitated tax scenarios are not covered
by Drasa.

********************************************
Usage
********************************************

Download the main ( and unique ) script and move into it's directory.

If not executable, make it: 
* sudo chmod u+x drasa.sh

Then simply launch it and follow its instructions.

Drasa is not a business consultant, so it cannot calculate your
outcoming expenses and, for now, cannot calculate the percentage of
IRPEF to subtract to your total incoming.

So, for now, it gives you a worst overview of the reality, where I mean
that it gives you a predition of your net incomings that is lower than
what you actually are gonna earn.
