DRASA
============================================



********************************************
DESCRIPTION
********************************************

Drasa is a simple bash script to have an overview of italian taxes.

It's dumb and made for my own purposes, so actually can calculate taxes
only for > 30k incomings.

"Regime dei minimi" and other facilitated tax scenarios are not covered
by Drasa.

********************************************
USAGE
********************************************

Download the main ( and unique ) script and move into it's directory.

If not executable, make it: 
* sudo chmod u+x drasa.sh

Then simply launch it and follow its instructions.

********************************************
TRUSTWORTHY?
********************************************

Drasa is not a business consultant, so it cannot calculate your
outcoming expenses and, for now, cannot calculate the percentage of
IRPEF to subtract to your total incoming.

So, for now, it gives you a worst overview of the reality, where I mean
that it gives you a predition of your net incomings that is lower than
what you actually are gonna earn.

********************************************
HELP!
********************************************

Feel free to fork and contact me, or just give me any hints if you have
more information than me about the ordinary taxes management in Italy.

Needs to be implemented:
* a way to calculate taxes over 75k
* a way to calculate the percentage of IRPEF to scale from the total amount of taxes
* a way to calculate the percentage of
    + petrol
    + phone
    + common expenses
    + rent
  to scale from the total amount of taxes
